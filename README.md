## SortedSet, SortedMap for Ur/Web

based on AATree [wikipedia version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_tree)

The Haskell version I made first
has been tested with QuickCheck and passes tests for all properties of the AATrees

There is no QuickCheck for Ur yet (at the time of writing)

I am working in testing routines and proofs you can find at

test/HUrUnit
test/util/HUnitTest
test/aatree_test
